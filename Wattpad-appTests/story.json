    "description": "When Jade Rochelle was ten years old, her first kiss was stolen by Jared Felton. Six years later Jade has still not forgiven him, although she doesn't really have to worry about it seen as she knows she will never see him again. This all changes when none other than the Jared Felton enrolls in her school, looking more gorgeous than ever.\n\nJared quickly becomes worshipped at Eastwood high, despite his bad attendance record, awful attitude, low care tolerance for school and the cocky smirk which never seems to leave his lips; he still finds a way to make everyone in a 10K radius fall in love with him.\n\nWell, everyone except Jade. \n\nAnd Jared is willing to do anything to change that.\n\nCan Jared win Jade over, or will he always just be the boy who stole her first kiss?\n\n♥My Stolen First Kiss reached #1 on Teen Fiction 20/8/14\n♥My Stolen First Kiss reached #1 on Humor on 20/8/14\n\n[Story will be properly edited when completed]",
